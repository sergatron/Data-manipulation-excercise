# --- REPLACE THE MISSING VALUES WITH 'S' ---
# in the data frame 'titanic', replace the missing values in the embarked column, with 'S'

# 2: ------ AGE ------
# 1. Calculate the mean of Age and use it to populate the missing values
# 2. Think about other ways you could have populated the missing values in the age column. 
#     Why would you pick any of those over the mean (or not)? 

# 2. Other ways to fill in the missing Age:
# --- Given number of siblings and parents in the data, you can make a better estimate of age group based on parents' and siblings' age. 
# Although it requires more work, it would represent a more accurate age. For example, if it is known that a set of parents have one child and
# their ages are 35 and 30, common sense will tell us that it is unlikely that any of their children will be over the age of 10 or so.

# 3: ------ LIFEBOAT ------

# many passengers did not make it to a boat :-( This means that there are a lot of missing values in the boat column.

# 4: ------ CABIN ------
# You notice that many passengers donâ€™t have a cabin number associated with them.
# --- Does it make sense to fill missing cabin numbers with a value?
# --- What does a missing value here mean?
# You have a hunch that the fact that the cabin number is missing might be a useful indicator of survival. 
# Create a new column has_cabin_number which has 1 if there is a cabin number, and 0 otherwise.
